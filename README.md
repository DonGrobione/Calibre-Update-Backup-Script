A simple script that will download the latest Calibre Portable update from https://calibre-ebook.com/download_portable.

Then it will user 7zip to create a backup file of the Calibre Portable folder. If you have your library located in a sub folder, it will be backed up too.
I set it up, that the archive volume will be split every 4 GB, as I use OneDrive and sometimes there are issues with big files and some corporate policies. If this does not apply to you, just remove that parameter.
